Dear friends!!!

I thank you for deciding to use my script for your site.

1. Installing the script on the server

Installing the script on the server is automatic and should not cause any problems, but you need to perform some steps to configure access rights to folders.

First, copy all the files from this archive to your server.
Set the permissions for the folders data, files, cache and all the folders enclosed in them (CHMOD 777)
Set write permissions for all files in the templates folder (CHMOD 666)
Run the installation at / install and follow its instructions.
The automatic installer will check all the necessary files and configure the connection to the database.
After installation is complete, the admin panel will be available at / admin
Attention: After installing or updating the script on the server, be sure to delete the / install folder

We hope that working with my script will give you only pleasure.



All the Best,
